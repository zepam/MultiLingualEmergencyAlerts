Imagine you work at the FCC. Write a short emergency alert, no more than 360 characters, about {DISASTER} in {LANGUAGE}. Include fields for [TIME], [LOCATION], and a [URL] for more information so it can be customized; these fields should be in English. The alert doesnâ€™t need a header, just a message body.

Only return the text of the alert in {LANGUAGE}. Do not include any other response to the prompt.
